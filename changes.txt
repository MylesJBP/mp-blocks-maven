The comments for our initial submission of MP1 were as follows:
1. You seem to be failing some of the test cases.
We fixed this issue through fixing errors in our HComp and Grid classes. 

HComp was fixed through our "row" method, where an extra varaible "diffHeightCheck", which got the height difference
between a given AsciiBlock and the overall height, was used to check if that difference was even or odd. This was
previously an issue because we were initially checking the difference with "diffHeight", which took the
difference / 2 (to get the difference from each end). This did not accurately
return the overall difference, causing issues with our row identification process.

Grid was fixed through our "row", "height", and "width" methods. Fixing the row method required removing a lot of the
code so that we were only returning a single row of an AsciiBlock rather than the entire AsciiBlock every time it was called.
The height method was fixed by returning the number of vreps x the height of the AsciiBlock rather than just returning vreps.
The width method was fixed by returning the number of hreps x the width of the AsciiBlock rather than just returning hreps.

2. Make sure to fix your styling issues with indentations, whitespaces, and stub comments.
We just went through and fixed all of the checkstyle erros in the class files using mvn checkstyle:check.
There were some in basically every file so there aren't any specific places of importance. It mainly consisted of fixing
trailing spaces and adding comments for methods and loops.

3. Missing a couple of names for your class headers
We added our names to all of the classes that we contributed to. 
We also changed the class description for our ChessBoard class.

4. Mising adequate test cases for you new block.
